I am Matteo Fincato, a dedicated Ph.D. student affiliated with the esteemed [AImageLab](https://aimagelab.ing.unimore.it/imagelab/) research group at the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, mentored by [Prof. Roberto Vezzani](https://aimagelab.ing.unimore.it/imagelab/person.asp?idpersona=8). My academic journey delves into the captivating realms of Computer Vision and Deep Learning.

My research focuses on two primary areas. Firstly, I explore the intricacies of **Human Pose Estimation**, dedicating efforts to developing methods for precise 2D/3D Single/Multi-Person pose estimation using single-camera inputs. My goal is to contribute novel solutions enhancing the accuracy of human pose analysis. Simultaneously, my work extends into **Virtual Try-On**, reflecting my interest in the intersection of technology and fashion. I craft innovative approaches for virtual clothing trials, exploring seamless integration of computer vision and deep learning techniques in the fashion industry.

Guided by Prof. Roberto Vezzani, my commitment to pushing the boundaries of knowledge in Computer Vision and Deep Learning remains steadfast. I am enthusiastic about contributing meaningful advancements to these fields and leveraging technology to address real-world challenges.
