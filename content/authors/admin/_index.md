# Professional Profile

I am Matteo Fincato, holding a Ph.D. in Computer Engineering from the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, where I conducted my research within the AImageLab under the supervision of Prof. Roberto Vezzani. My core expertise is rooted in the application and advancement of **Computer Vision** and **Deep Learning** methodologies.

## Doctoral Research and Contributions

My doctoral research was primarily focused on developing robust and accurate solutions for **3D/2D Human Pose Estimation (HPE)**, applicable to both single and multi-person scenarios within **complex industrial environments**. This work aimed to significantly enhance the reliability and precision of human pose analysis in real-world settings.

## Post-Doctoral and Industry Expertise

Following the Ph.D., my professional activity has been concentrated on high-impact Computer Vision applications:

* **Automotive (In-Vehicle Monitoring):** I have specialized in the study and implementation of techniques for **Human Shape Estimation** dedicated to the analysis and precise monitoring of passengers inside vehicle cabins.
* **Healthcare (In-Bed Patient Monitoring):** I have developed **3D Pose Estimation** methodologies for non-invasive, continuous monitoring of patients in bed within clinical and assisted living facilities.

## Previous Experience

Prior to my doctoral studies, I was involved in research fellowship activities focused on **Virtual Try-On** systems, integrating Computer Vision and Deep Learning techniques to deliver innovative solutions for the fashion industry.
